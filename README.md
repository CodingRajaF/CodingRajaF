# 🎉 Welcome to My GitHub
Thanks for stopping by! Here you’ll find a mix of experiments, automation tools, and a few adventures in coding.

✨ If any of my projects made your life easier (or just made you smile), consider leaving a ⭐.  It really keeps the motivation flowing!

## 🚀 What you’ll find here
- 🛠️ Automation tools (Excel, OCR, browser extensions…)
- 📊 Data wrangling & analysis experiments
- 🎮 Hobby projects (game-inspired, just for fun)
> ⚡ Not many repos yet, but hey — Rome wasn’t built in a day. Come back later and you might find something new!

## 💡My Philosophy on Code

I see code as a "language" that connects people and the future.  
Inspired by the idea of a *mediator* from a certain story, I want to use code to bridge humans and what lies ahead.  

What drives me is creating experiences woven through code — and in the long run, I aim to expand my work in the DX (Digital Transformation) field, building bridges that benefit society as a whole.  

# 📚 Language
